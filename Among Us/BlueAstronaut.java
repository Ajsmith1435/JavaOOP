//Methods
	//emergencyMeeting() - A Player that is frozen cannot call an emergency meeting. Holds a meeting and votes out (freezes) the most suspicious individual of the Player objects, only considering Players that are not frozen The player that has the highest susLevel will be accused of being the impostor and will be voted off (This could be them!) If two players have the same highest susLevel, no player will be voted off. Hint: think of an easy way to do this without having to iterate through the entire array. Check the Java API for Arrays for a method you can use. Make sure to change the frozen variable of the player to true when voting off players (don't call freeze!) At the end of the vote, check if the game is over using the provided method in Player.java Does not return anything

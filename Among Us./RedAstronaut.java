	// emergencyMeeting() - A Player that is frozen cannot call an emergency meeting. Holds a meeting and votes out (freezes) the most suspicious Player, only considering Players that are not frozen The player that has the highest susLevel (that is NOT the current impostor calling the meeting) will be accused of being the impostor and will be voted off If two players have the same highest susLevel, no player will be voted off.

If the passed in Player is an Impostor, the method should end. Freezing an already frozen Player should also do nothing. A freeze is successful if the RedAstronaut's susLevel is less than the Player's If the freeze is unsuccessful, the RedAstronaut's susLevel doubles (multiply the current susLevel by 2) Remember to change the frozen boolean value for the Crewmate as needed. After the freeze attempt, check if the game is over using the provided method in Player.java Does not return anything

If the Impostor's susLevel is under 20, through shifty maneuvers and cunning words, they are able to increase the Crewmateâ€™s susLevel by 50% Otherwise, they can only manage to increase the Crewmate's susLevel by 25% (Note: In both cases, the the Crewmate's susLevel is rounded down to the nearest int value) Does not return anything
